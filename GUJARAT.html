traditions glorifying the State. The diverse and vibrant state of Gujarat has a significant contribution to the cultural aspect of India. The sheer simplicity and amiability of Gujarati’s have made them a flourishing community. The state of Gujarat boasts a vibrant art, architecture, culture, and heritage;
 all of which is quite evident in the day-to-day lives of the locals. The diversity exhibited by Gujarat is a result of the various ethnic groups constituting Gujarat’s population; including Indic and Dravidian groups.
